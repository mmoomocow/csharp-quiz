[AS91883 - Develop a computer program](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91883.pdf)
[AS91884 - Use basic iterative processes to develop a digital outcome](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91884.pdf)

## Purpose of the program
The purpose of the program is to **train our St John youth team** for regional comps by having a fun and competitive game (tic tac toe) that requires them to correctly answer questions before they can make a move in the game.
