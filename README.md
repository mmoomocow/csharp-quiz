## Purpose of the program
The purpose of the program is to **train our St John youth team** for regional comps by having a fun and competitive game (tic tac toe) that requires them to correctly answer questions before they can make a move in the game.

## Target audience
My target audience is my St John youth team, a group of 13 - 17 year olds who have an understanding of basic first aid, and are learning more complex first aid.

## Describing Relevant Implications (A)

### Social

* Ensuring the final quiz is what the client wants

**I will do this by:**
* Using language that can be understood by my target audience
